'''Write a program that reads an integer value from the input and checks if it is positive.

Hints:

0 is not a positive number.A comparison already returns a boolean, so if you need the result of the comparison,
you can print it, like this print(5 > 9) # False

Sample Input 1:

8
Sample Output 1:

True'''
# Please don't modify this code0
1.
# `a` stores an input value
#a = int(input().strip())
#print(a==8)
# put your code here
2.
a = int(input().strip())
positive = (a<9)
print(a!=positive)

Failed test #2 of 8. Wrong answer
